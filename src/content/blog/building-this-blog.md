I wanted a simple way to be able to improve my writing as well as share some of passions as a type of online journal. 

Here's how I set it up.

## The Stack 
- Astro content collections for blog posts
- Markdown files with frontmatter
- Tag-based filtering 
- RSS feed for good measure

## Why Astro? 
I already had my portfolio on Astro, so adding a blog was straightforward.

Content collections handle all of the heavy lifting, and I can write posts in plain markdown.

No database, no CMS to maintain. Just `git commit && git push` and off we go.

## What's Next
I'm planning to add: 
- Image optimization
- Reading time estimates 
- Maybe a simple comment system

I really want to become more comfortable with Astro because it seems fun and really extensible for a lot of use cases.

For now though, it does exactly what I need it to do.
