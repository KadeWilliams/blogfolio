This week I decided to tackled a simple yet delicious Italian dish: Bolognese. 

## The Setup 

I've been wanting to make this for years. The key is really giving it the time it deserves to braise and develop that deep rich flavor.

## Ingredients
- 1 pound of pork 
- 1 pound of beef
- 28oz can of crushed tomatoes (I used Bianco DiNapoli)
- half tube of tomato paste
- 1 cup+ of white wine
- soffritto
    - 3 celery sticks
    - 1 large carrot 
    - 1 large onion
- 2 bay leaves 
- 3 tbsp of italian herb seasoning/spice mix

## What I Learned 
- 1
- 2
- 3

## The Verdict
It was better than I could have expected it to be. 

I would honestly say that, prior to this dish, I really didn't love pasta, wasn't ever something I felt compelled to make.

After having this, and considering the ease and simplicity of it, I understand why it's a staple. 

Would I make it again? Absolutely. It's worth of being in the regular rotation.
