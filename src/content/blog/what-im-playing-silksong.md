The long awaited sequel to one of my favorite games of all time has finally arrived. 

## Preface 
Just want to say, I really enjoy the gameplay and when it's good, it's really good.

And some of the criticisms I might level toward Team Cherry's newest installment can also be applied to the original game. 


## Thoughts 

### The Good
- Combat 
    - They've been able to make the combat feel familiar and fresh at the same time. 
    - Fights feel challenging but rarely unfair, especially if you're upgrading needle.
    - Creative enemy types keep you on your toes throughout.
- Atmosphere
    - Traversing each of the environments is really such a joy and they're equally parts beautiful and grotesque and the depth I feel within this 2D world is remarkable.
    - The music and audio stage is also a triumph in sound design as well as the, albeit limited, voice acting. 

### The Bad 
- I find the side quests to be a bit of a half-baked idea. I appreciate the effort to bring more activities and attempting to build a more cohesive world that the character is able to participate and interact with. 
- Despite the introduction of the transit system as well as the bell beast to quickly navigate throughout the sprawling world, I feel like I do so much back tracking. I understand that it's a metroidvania (a genre that I would probably say is my favorite) and to some extent that's the nature of them. It's one thing to backtrack, it's another when you're aimlessly backtracking trying to figure out where to go, just gets frustrating.
